# SERAP's Lawsuits Engagements
# Introduction 
Nigeria, with a population exceeding 223 million, holds the distinction of being Africa's most populous nation. Surprisingly, only 4 out of 10 Nigerians actively participate in political matters, leading to a serious dearth of accountability and transparency in governance. Efforts from various Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) and Civil Society Organizations (CSOs) to foster civic engagement have encountered substantial challenges, with millions of dollars spent across the 36 states, yielding limited success.

SERAP Nigeria, a leading NGO dedicated to fostering transparency and accountability, recently garnered the attention of over 3000 Nigerians, inviting them to join the movement against irrational spending by the 9th National Assembly. Analyzing the distribution of responses across the 36 states and the FCT promises fascinating insights crucial for addressing the persisting challenges faced by NGOs and CSOs in the country.

**The primary objectives of this analysis are as follows:**
1) To explore the distribution of respondents interested in SERAP's Lawsuits across the 36 states, assessing the correlation of response frequencies with the geopolitical zones and political parties. This exploration aims to guide the strategic deployment of impactful projects in various states across Nigeria.
2) To conduct an in-depth analysis of SERAP's costs incurred in different states concerning awareness campaigns, town hall meetings, and lawsuit engagements in relation to the number of respondents. These costs will be approximated by benchmarking against similar events held in the region.
